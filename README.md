# py_pet-terminal
First py_pet programm for terminal usage

# Idea
After I found my 23 something year old Tamagotchi this sparked the idea to create a Tamagotchi style game in Python to learn code.
Those pets will be enhanced if possible in iterations and the usage of pygame.

# Main Functions
Pet will start. You can ask for stats, feed it, chat with it and end it.
## ToDo
so much!
- [x] Ask for weather by calling an API? Woop that was nice and easy!!
